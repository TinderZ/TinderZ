# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TinderZ
### ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Deep Reinforcement Learning and LLMs.
- My current focus revolves around multi-agent systems, where I'm investigating both LLM-based architectures and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approaches.
#### Beyond multi-agent systems, I also dive into fascinating areas like:
- LLM Structured Reasoning,  Combating LLM Hallucinations, and so on.
- Explainable Reinforcement Learning: Particularly, I'm fascinated by the interpretability of RL in complex domains like Go (å›´æ£‹), and how these insights might be generalized to other fields, such as AI4Science.
## Let's Connect!
- I'm always open to collaboration and discussion on these topics. 
- Feel free to reach out if you share similar interests or have exciting projects in mind!
